### Manual Presentation

If you wish to manually present a `WhatsNewView` you can make use of the `sheet(whatsNew:)` modifier.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @State
    var whatsNew: WhatsNew = // ...
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            // ...
        }
        .sheet(
            whatsNew: self.$whatsNew
        )
    }
    
}
```

### Automatic Presentation

Beside manually presenting a WhatsNewView you can make use of the automatic presentation which allows you to simply declare your new features for each version.

To enable the automatic presentation simply configure the `WhatsNewEnvironment` via the `environment` modifier.

A `WhatsNewEnvironment` takes in the following two parameters:

- `versionStore`: A WhatsNewVersionStore which is used to save the versions that have been presented to the user.
- `whatsNew`: A WhatsNewCollectionProvider which provides a WhatsNew instance for a specific version.

```swift
struct App: SwiftUI.App {

    // A WhatsNewEnvironment
    // Saves presented versions in the UserDefaults
    // WhatsNew instances are provided by a `WhatsNewCollectionProvider`
    let whatsNewEnvironment = WhatsNewEnvironment(
        versionStore: UserDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore()
        whatsNew: self
    )

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(\.whatsNew, self.whatsNewEnvironment)
        }
    }

}

extension App: WhatsNewCollectionProvider {

    /// A WhatsNewCollection
    var whatsNewCollection: WhatsNewCollection {
        WhatsNew(
            version: "1.0.0",
            // ...
        )
        WhatsNew(
            version: "1.1.0",
            // ...
        )
        WhatsNew(
            version: "1.2.0",
            // ...
        )
    }

}
```

After configuring the `WhatsNewEnvironment` simply add a `whatsNewSheet()` modifier to a view where the `WhatsNewView` should be presented.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            // ...
        }
        .whatsNewSheet()
    }

}
```

## WhatsNewVersionStore

A `WhatsNewVersionStore` is a protocol type which is responsible for saving versions that have been presented to the user as well as returning the already presented versions.

WhatsNewKit comes along with three predefined implementations:

- `UserDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore`: Persists versions in the UserDefaults
- `NSUbiquitousKeyValueWhatsNewVersionStore`: Persists versions in iCloud
- `InMemoryWhatsNewVersionStore`: Stores versions in memory (Perfect for testing purposes)

If you already have a specific implementation to store user related settings like Realm or Core Data you can easily adopt your existing implementation to the `WhatsNewVersionStore`.

## WhatsNew

The following sections explains how a `WhatsNew` struct can be initialized in order to describe the new features for a given version of your app.

```swift
let whatsnew = WhatsNew(
    version: "1.0.0",
    title: "What's New",
    features: [
        WhatsNew.Feature(
            image: .init(systemName: "star.fill"),
            title: "Title",
            subtitle: "Subtitle"
        )
    ],
    primaryAction: WhatsNew.PrimaryAction(
        title: "Continue",
        backgroundColor: .accentColor,
        foregroundColor: .white,
        hapticFeedback: .notification(.success),
        onDimiss: {
            print("Primary Action was tapped")
        }
    ),
    secondaryAction: WhatsNew.SecondaryAction(
        title: "Learn more",
        foregroundColor: .accentColor,
        hapticFeedback: .selection,
        action: .openURL(
            .init(string: "https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit")
        )
    )
)
```

### WhatsNew.Version

The `WhatsNew.Version` specifies the version that has introduced certain features to your app.

```swift
// Initialize with major, minor, and patch
let version = WhatsNew.Version(
    major: 1, 
    minor: 0, 
    patch: 0
)

// Initialize by string literal
let version: WhatsNew.Version = "1.0.0"

// Initialize WhatsNew Version by using the current version of your bundle
let version: WhatsNew.Version = .current()
```

### WhatsNew.Title

A `WhatsNew.Title` represents the title text that is rendered above the features.

```swift
// Initialize by string literla
let title: WhatsNew.Title = "Continue"

// Initialize with text and foreground color
let title = WhatsNew.Title(
    text: "Continue",
    foregroundColor: .primary
)

// On >= iOS 15 initialize with AttributedString using Markdown
let title = WhatsNew.Title(
    text: try AttributedString(
        markdown: "What's **New**"
    )
)
```

### WhatsNew.Feature

A `WhatsNew.Feature` describe a specific feature of your app and generally consist of an image, title, and subtitle.

```swift
let feature = WhatsNew.Feature(
    image: .init(
        uiImage: UIImage(named: "DesignIcon")
    ),
    title: "New Design",
    subtitle: .init(
        try AttributedString(
            markdown: "An awesome new _Design_"
        )
    )
)
```

### WhatsNew.PrimaryAction

The `WhatsNew.PrimaryAction` allows you to configure the behaviour of the primary button which is used to dismiss the presented `WhatsNewView`

```swift
let primaryAction = WhatsNew.PrimaryAction(
    title: "Continue",
    backgroundColor: .blue,
    foregroundColor: .white,
    hapticFeedback: .notification(.success),
    onDismiss: {
        print("WhatsNew dismissed")
    }   
)
```

### WhatsNew.SecondaryAction

A `WhatsNew.SecondaryAction` which is displayed above the `WhatsNew.PrimaryAction` can be optionally supplied when initializing a `WhatsNew` instance and allows you to either present an additional View or open a URL.

```swift
let secondaryActionPresentAboutView = WhatsNew.SecondaryAction(
    title: "Learn more",
    foregroundColor: .blue,
    hapticFeedback: .selection,
    action: .present {
        AboutView()
    }  
)

let secondaryActionOpenURL = WhatsNew.SecondaryAction(
    title: "Read more",
    foregroundColor: .blue,
    hapticFeedback: .selection,
    action: .open(
        url: .init(string: "https://github.com/SvenTiigi/WhatsNewKit")
    )  
)
```

## Layout

WhatsNewKit allows you to adjust the layout of a presented `WhatsNewView` in various ways.

The most simple way is by mutating the `default` WhatsNewView Layout instance.

```swift
WhatsNewView.Layout.default.featureListSpacing = 35
```

When using the automatic presentation style you can supply a default WhatsNewView Layout when initializing the WhatsNewEnvironment.

```swift
.environment(
    \.whatsNew,
    .init(
        defaultLayout: .init(
            showsScrollViewIndicators: true,
            featureListSpacing: 35
        ),
        whatsNew: self
    )
)
```

Alternatively you can pass a `WhatsNewView.Layout` when presenting the WhatsNewView

```swift
.sheet(
    whatsNew: self.$whatsNew,
    layout: .init(
        footerActionSpacing: 20
    )
)

.whatsNewSheet(
    layout: .init(
        contentPadding: .init(
            top: 80, 
            leading: 0,
            bottom: 0,
            trailing: 0
        )
    )
)
```

## WhatsNewViewController

When using `UIKit` you can make use of the `WhatsNewViewController`.

```swift
let whatsNewViewController = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: WhatsNew(
        version: "1.0.0",
        // ...
    ),
    layout: WhatsNewView.Layout(
        contentSpacing: 80
    )
)
```

If you wish to present a `WhatsNewViewController` only if the version of the WhatsNew instance has not been presented you can make use of the convenience failable initializer.

```swift
// Verify WhatsNewViewController is available for presentation
guard let whatsNewViewController = WhatsNewViewController(
    whatsNew: WhatsNew(
        version: "1.0.0",
        // ...
    ),
    versionStore: UserDefaultsWhatsNewVersionStore()
) else {
    // Version of WhatsNew has already been presented
    return
}

// Present WhatsNewViewController
// Version will be automatically saved in the provided
// WhatsNewVersionStore when the WhatsNewViewController gets dismissed
self.present(whatsNewViewController, animated: true)
```
